I developed  "Indoku" a 2x2 Sudoku puzzle as a web app but with Indic numerals. One can test their reasoning and inference skills in this game. The player has to solve a  4 blocks Sudoku in the shortest time. The twist here is that the two of the diagonal blocks have numerals in two of 11 possible different Indian scripts that are supported, thus you implicitly learn the Indic numbers when you solve this puzzle.

Try this game either on a desktop or a handheld device.
